This is my Final year project. User can record voice for 4-5 seconds and based on the given voice, different frequencies (**MFCC**, **CHORMA**) are extracted and the emotion is predected.

- Classification in 4 classes (**Sad**, **Happy**, **Angry** and **Fearful**)
- **KNN**, **SVN** and other models are used and compared to chose the best model among them.
