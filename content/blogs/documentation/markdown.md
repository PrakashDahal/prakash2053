Markdown is simple and powerful text formatter. I mostly use it for blogging and note taking.
<!--more-->

## Overview 

I recently presented about markdown and wanted to share with you too. So here it is.

- It is a Markup language to format text. 

- You can use it for the following things:
  - Taking Notes
  - Writing Blogs
  - Documenting
  - Generating Static site
  - Writing Books ... so on
  <br />
  <br />

- Different applications have implemented markdown like:
  - Slack
  - Trello
  - Github
  - Ghostwriter
  - Discord 
  - Juyter notebook ... so on

Let's first see some basics of MarkDown from the pdf slide that I have created before.

## Pandoc

Using `pandoc`, I can change file format from .md to .pdf or .txt to .md or .md to latex, I can go on and on for this so let's stop here.

You have to install pandoc in your machine. 
<a href="https://pandoc.org/installing.html" target="_blank">Check Official Doc</a>

Some basic pandoc commands are:

{{< copyquote >}}
```bash
pandoc slide.md -o slide.pdf
```
{{< /copyquote >}}

{{< copyquote >}}
```bash
pandoc slide.md -o slide.txt
```
{{< /copyquote >}}

To generate a pdf like I have createD above, you have to add some theme in it. I used `beamer`, which is based on latex, and some themes to give a decent look for the slide.

_Note: You may have to install some additional latex dependencies to use beamer_

{{< copyquote >}}
```bash
pandoc -t beamer -V theme=Berlin -V colortheme=seahorse slide.md -o slide.pdf
```
{{< /copyquote >}} 

The simple architecture of Pandoc is: 

`[input format] ==reader ==> [Pandoc AST] == writer==> [output format]`

If you want to know more about the architecture, <a href="https://pandoc.org/using-the-pandoc-api.html" target="_blank">Check Official Documentation</a>
