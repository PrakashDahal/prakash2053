## How to Play

Imagine you see the combination: `hewollorld`. By rearranging the letters, you can form the word `hello`, `hell`, `world`, `word` and so on. You can type a word and enter to type another word. You will score multiple points till `times up`! However, beware of `non-existing letters`; for instance, typing `horse` when the letters `s` and `e` are not present will result in a `penalty` of `-1`.

## Guide Line

- Look for valid English words within the jumbled letters.
- Type your answers into the provided input field.
- Hit 'Enter' to submit your word.

## Scoring

Earn points for each correctly identified word. The more challenging the word, the higher your score! \
_Note: Longer the word, higher the score_

Get ready to exercise your brain and uncover words in the most unexpected combinations. Have fun playing WordCraft Challenge!
