Still waiting for your system updates to finish? Guess that's the difference between Arch users and everyone else. Here’s why I use Arch Linux.

<!--more-->

Switching to Arch Linux was a game-changer for me. Here’s a glimpse why I chose Arch. 

`Here, when I say Arch, I mean the core Arch itself, not distros`

1. Rolling Release Model

One of the major reason to use arch is its <b>rolling release model</b>. This means I get the latest software updates as soon as they’re available.
<b>No more waiting </b> for the next big release like with other Linux distributions or Windows updates. It’s like having <b> Christmas every week </b> with new features and fixes constantly rolling in.

This always keeps my system <b> fresh and cutting-edge </b> without the need to reinstall the OS every six months.

`Do you want to be up to date?`

2. DIY: Make Your Choices

Another Cool aspect of Arch is <b> Do It Yourself. </b> It gives you the Freedom to build your system exactly how you want it. You have the full power of your system. But beginners can get confused and daunting easily. ;( Noob

3. Explore linux

Since Arch follows its principle <b> DIY,</b> it compels you to learn and understand what you are doing. It has a great [documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) explained each and everything in detail. Still it can feel overwhelming because you have to setup your config, packages, window manager or window environment and so on. 

Note: `If you do not want to learn and grow, Stay away from Arch and me`

4. Performance

Another major reason to use arch is <b> performance.</b> Here is the list of things which increases your system performance if you are using arch.

- Light weight
- Minimal design
- Updated software
- Efficient Package manager
- Highly customizable

Note: `These are my super favorite points.`

5. To say "I use Arch, BTW"

Installing Arch is not easy so it makes you feel proud of this achievement. 

### Installation 

It takes time to explore and understand Arch so if you are not confident enough install in Virtual Machine first. 

[Arch documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) is the best but this can be hard to follow along while installing.
[Free Code Camp Documentation](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-install-arch-linux/) can be a good option to install arch.
